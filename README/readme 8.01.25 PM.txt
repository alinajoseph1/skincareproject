My project is based off my interest in skincare. 
I decided to make a website where you can create a user profile and with that user profile
you have to select a skin concern, which is what your skin is classified as such as oily, 
combination, dry, or normal. And through selecting your skin concern you learn information 
about that concern in your dashboard and you can be led to product recommendations for that concern.

Main features of my project would be that when you select your skin concern
your dashboard shows you information on that selected concern and if you want to change 
your selected concern you can do that as well to learn about a different skin type. 
Through this project I was able to get a better grasp on concepts that I thought I fully
understood and I feel confident in the results. 

what didn't go well, was I had an issue with my route saving my "many" data and it took me 
awhile to ask for help and figure out what I was doing wrong. 

Overall, I am happy with the outcome and feel confident in what I've created.
